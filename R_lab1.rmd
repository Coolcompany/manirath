## R Markdown
```{r}

```

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

```{r}
survey <- read.table("survey_data.csv", header=TRUE, sep=",")
View(survey)

```

```{r}
sum(survey[["Program"]] == "MISM" | survey[["Program"]] == "Other")
```

```{r}
survey$OperatingSystem
```

```{r}
pi
```


```
```{r}
qplot(x=EngineSize, y=MPG.city, data=Cars93, 
      colour=Cylinders, 
      shape=Cylinders,
      xlab = "Engine size (litres)",
      ylab = "Fuel economy (MPG city)"
      )
```

```{r}
qplot(x=EngineSize, y=MPG.city, data=Cars93, 
      colour=Cylinders, 
      shape=Cylinders,
      xlab = "Engine size (litres)",
      ylab = "Fuel economy (MPG city)"
      )
```

```{r}
diamond.plot <- ggplot(data=diamonds, aes(x=carat, y=price))
diamond.plot + geom_point()
```

```{r}
diamond.plot <- ggplot(data=diamonds, aes(x=carat, y=price, colour = color))

diamond.plot + geom_point() + facet_wrap(~ cut)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
