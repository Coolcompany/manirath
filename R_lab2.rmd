## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

We'll begin by loading all the required packages.
```{r}
library(MASS)
library(lattice)
library(ggplot2)
str(Cars93)

```

#### Plotting the Cars93 data

This problem uses the Cars93 dataset from the MASS package.

**(a)** Use `qplot` to create a scatterplot with Price on the y-axis and EngineSize on the `x-axis`.  

```{r, fig.align='center', fig.height=4, fig.width=5}
qplot(x = EngineSize, y = Price, data = Cars93)
```

**(b)** Repeat part (a) using the `ggplot` function and `geom_point()` layer.

```{r, fig.align='center', fig.height=4, fig.width=5}
ggplot(Cars93, aes(x = EngineSize, y = Price)) + geom_point()
```

**(c)** Repeat part (b), but this time specifying that the `color` mapping should depend on `Type` and the `shape` mapping should depend on `DriveTrain`.  

```{r, fig.align='center', fig.height=4, fig.width=5}
ggplot(Cars93, aes(x = EngineSize, y = Price, colour = Type, shape = DriveTrain)) + geom_point()
```



```{r}
birthwt <- transform(birthwt, 
            race = as.factor(mapvalues(race, c(1, 2, 3), 
                              c("white","black", "other"))),
            mother.smokes = as.factor(mapvalues(mother.smokes, c(0,1), c("no", "yes"))),
            hypertension = as.factor(mapvalues(hypertension, 
                              c(0,1), c("no", "yes"))),
            uterine.irr = as.factor(mapvalues(uterine.irr, 
                              c(0,1), c("no", "yes")))
            )

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
